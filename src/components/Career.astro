        While interning at Sky, I worked with one full-stack web development and
        DevOps team. I had the privilege to get my hands dirty with front-end
        technologies, back-end ones and everything in between. From
        documentation management to Docker containerization üê≥.

        Working at TSYS, I had the freedom to design the DocOps flow used by the
        Knaresborough branch. My work heavily relied on Python and Docker during
        the prototyping stage and AWS and GCP during the deployment phase ‚òÅÔ∏è.
