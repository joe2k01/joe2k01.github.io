          <p>
            During my time interning at Sky I worked with a full-stack
            web-development and DevOps team. I had the privilege to get my hands
            dirty with front-end technologies, back-end ones and everything in
            between. From documetation management to Docker containerization üê≥.

          <p>
            Working at TSYS, I was given the freedom to design the DocOps flow
            used by the Knaresborough branch. My work heavily relied on Python
            and Docker during the prototyping stage, and then on AWS and GCP
            during the deployment phase.
